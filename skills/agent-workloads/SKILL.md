# Agent Workloads

Use this skill as the **front door** for coding and repo work in joelclaw.

If the real question is:

> what is this work, how should it run, and what should happen next?

load this skill before touching substrate-specific docs.

If the work is really about external repo bridging or low-level runtime submission mechanics, _then_ the `restate-workflows` skill may matter. For normal coding/repo work, this skill comes first.

## What this skill is for

- turning Joel steering into an execution shape
- choosing between **serial**, **parallel**, and **chained** work
- deciding whether a task should stay inline or move to a durable/sandboxed path
- defining the handoff contract between workers
- keeping repo/coding work agent-first instead of runtime-first

## Load Order

For serious workload design, also load:

- `cli-design` — future `joelclaw workload` surface and JSON contract
- `clawmail` — reservations, ownership, and handoffs
- `system-architecture` — real runtime topology
- `docker-sandbox` — isolation/backends when execution mode matters
- `codex-prompting` — if the workload will dispatch coding agents downstream

Canonical repo doc:

- `docs/workloads.md` — source of truth for workload vocabulary, request/plan/handoff schema, and shipped-vs-planned boundaries

## Core rule

**Do not make the caller choose the substrate unless that tradeoff is the task.**

The caller should describe intent.
The planner should decide execution.

Bad:

- “Should I use Restate or queue or sandbox or a loop?”

Good:

- “This is a chained repo workload with sandboxed implementation, inline verification, and docs closeout.”

## First pass: classify the workload

Ask or infer these inputs:

- workload kind (`repo.patch`, `repo.refactor`, `repo.docs`, `repo.review`, `research.spike`, `runtime.proof`, `cross-repo.integration`)
- objective
- acceptance criteria
- repo / file scope
- shape (`auto`, `serial`, `parallel`, `chained`)
- autonomy level
- proof posture (`none`, `dry-run`, `canary`, `soak`, `full`)
- risk posture (`reversible-only`, `sandbox-required`, `host-okay`, `deploy-allowed`, `human-signoff`)
- sequence constraints
- required artifacts

If those are fuzzy, shape the workload before dispatch.

## Choose the shape

### Serial

Use when steps depend on each other or risk is high.

Examples:

- fix → verify → commit
- canary → cleanup → truth update
- refactor → deploy check → docs

### Parallel

Use when branches are independent and comparison helps.

Examples:

- spike multiple approaches
- inspect multiple codepaths in parallel
- gather evidence from several repos/surfaces before synthesis

### Chained

Use when specialist stages add value and artifacts should flow forward.

Examples:

- implement → verify → docs
- research → planner → implementor → reviewer
- patch → canary → ADR truth

## Default execution bias

- prefer **inline** for obvious low-risk local tasks
- prefer **serial** for risky or dependent work
- prefer **parallel** to reduce uncertainty, not to look clever
- prefer **chained** when artifacts and stage boundaries matter
- prefer **sandboxed** execution when repo mutation is risky or isolation is the point

## Handoff rule

Every downstream worker should receive:

- goal
- current state
- artifacts produced
- verification already done
- remaining gates
- reserved file scope
- known risks/caveats
- exact next action

If the next worker has to reconstruct everything from chat history, the workload was shaped badly.

## Runtime boundary

This skill is the **product layer**.

Substrate skills remain implementation details:

- `restate-workflows` — external repo/runtime bridge details
- `docker-sandbox` — isolation/backends
- `agent-loop` — durable coding loop mechanics

Use them only after the workload shape is clear.

## Command surface

Shipped now:

```bash
joelclaw workload plan "<intent>" \
  [--preset docs-truth|research-compare|refactor-handoff] \
  [--repo /abs/path/or/owner/repo] \
  [--paths a,b,c] \
  [--paths-from status|head|recent:<n>] \
  [--write-plan ~/.joelclaw/workloads/]
```

Use it to get a canonical `request` + `plan` envelope, seed scope from real repo activity, and emit a reusable plan artifact for handoff.

Still planned:

```bash
joelclaw workload run "<intent>"
joelclaw workload status <id>
joelclaw workload explain <id>
joelclaw workload cancel <id>
```

Until the rest exists:

1. run `joelclaw workload plan`
2. classify or refine the workload
3. define artifacts and gates
4. dispatch through the appropriate existing surface
5. keep the handoff explicit

## Reference

Read the detailed workload catalog here:

- [references/common-workloads.md](./references/common-workloads.md)

## Rules

- start with workload shape, not runtime mechanism
- use the canonical vocabulary from `docs/workloads.md`; don't invent fresh field names unless the doc changes too
- implementation intent beats docs follow-through: `refactor ... then update docs` or `extend ... then update README` should still plan as implementation work
- preserve explicit `Acceptance:` clauses from the prompt when they exist; don't throw them away and replace them with mush
- mentioning a sandbox as the topic of research does not automatically mean the work must execute in a sandbox
- `deploy-allowed` should come from explicit release/deploy intent, not from nouns like `published skills`
- supervised repo work mentioning `canary` or `soak` does not automatically mean `durable` / `restate`
- use `Goal:` milestones and `reflect/update plan` cues to keep chained plans from collapsing into generic sludge
- if you are not inside the target repo and `workload plan` warns about the cwd not being a git repo, rerun with `--repo`
- use `--paths-from status|head|recent:<n>` when scope should come from actual repo activity instead of hand-typed path lists
- use `--write-plan` when another agent should be able to pick up the workload without reading raw chat
- never hand a coding agent substrate docs as the only answer to “how should I run this work?”
- serial / parallel / chained are first-class planning choices, not afterthoughts
- use `clawmail` for any delegated or shared-file workload
- keep outputs machine-usable and explicit
- if the best execution path is unclear, say so and produce a plan rather than guessing
