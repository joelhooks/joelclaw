# JoelClaw Observability + Logging

Prevent silent failure by default. Observability is not optional polish: it is part of done.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Use the canonical event contract only.
   - `packages/system-bus/src/observability/otel-event.ts`
   - `packages/system-bus/src/observability/emit.ts`
   - `packages/system-bus/src/observability/store.ts`
2. Worker/Inngest code emits through `emitOtelEvent` or `emitMeasuredOtelEvent`.
3. Gateway code emits through `emitGatewayOtel`.
4. Internal ingestion goes through `POST /observability/emit` (`packages/system-bus/src/serve.ts`), not ad-hoc writes.
5. Never treat `console.log` as primary observability. Keep structured events as source of truth.
6. High-cardinality values go in `metadata`, not in facet fields (`source`, `component`, `level`, `success`).
7. Failures must set `success: false` with a meaningful `error`.
8. For warn/error/fatal, verify Convex mirror behavior (rolling window) in addition to Typesense write.

## Event Conventions

- `source`: subsystem (`worker`, `gateway`, `webhook`, `memory`, `verification`, etc.)
- `component`: stable module/service name (`check-system-health`, `redis-channel`, `observe`)
- `action`: stable dotted action (`system.health.checked`, `events.immediate_telegram`)
- `metadata`: request IDs, deployment IDs, function IDs, session IDs, payload identifiers
- `duration_ms`: include for timed operations

Use event-per-hop (wide event style): one context-rich event for each major boundary/operation, not scattered string logs.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Identify the boundary being changed.
   - Inngest function, gateway channel, webhook route, API route, background job, sync step.
2. Add success and failure envelopes.
   - Start + completion for long tasks, or a single completion event for short tasks.
3. Include operational and business context in `metadata`.
   - Example: function id, event id, provider, queue depth, affected resource id.
4. Keep severity useful.
   - `debug/info` for normal activity, `warn` for degraded but recoverable, `error/fatal` for failures.
5. Run verification gates before finishing.

## Quick Patterns

### Worker / Inngest timed operation

```typescript
import { emitMeasuredOtelEvent } from "../../observability/emit";

await emitMeasuredOtelEvent(
  {
    level: "info",
    source: "worker",
    component: "content-sync",
    action: "content_sync.run",
    metadata: { trigger: event.name },
  },
  async () => {
    await runSync();
  }
);
```

### Gateway emission

```typescript
import { emitGatewayOtel } from "../observability";

await emitGatewayOtel({
  level: "error",
  component: "redis-channel",
  action: "events.immediate_telegram",
  success: false,
  error: "telegram_send_failed",
  metadata: { sessionId, queueDepth },
});
```

## Definition of Done

- Structured OTEL events added for the changed path.
- No direct feature-level writes to Typesense/Convex for observability data.
- Smoke probe passes (`scripts/otel-smoke.sh`).
- `joelclaw otel list` and `joelclaw otel stats` show expected behavior.
- New failure modes are queryable by `source`, `component`, and `action`.

## Helper Script

Use `scripts/otel-smoke.sh` for a fast end-to-end probe:

```bash
./skills/o11y-logging/scripts/otel-smoke.sh verification o11y-skill probe.emit
```
