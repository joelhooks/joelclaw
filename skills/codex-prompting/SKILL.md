# Codex Prompting Skill

## What this skill is for

Use this when the request is any of the following:
- "send to codex"
- "prompt codex"
- "use codex"
- "ask codex"
- "delegate to codex"
- "delegate this to codex"
- "run this in codex"
- "run in codex"
- "handoff to codex"
- "handoff this to codex"
- "codex this"

The job is to produce a high-signal Codex request that gets directly executed with minimal ambiguity.

## Required model default

- Codex tasks must set model to `gpt-5.3-codex` when unspecified.
- Use an explicit model override only when user explicitly requests another.

## System shape to anchor Codex prompts

- Orchestrated by `packages/system-bus` and durable `Inngest` functions.
- Event bridge and notifications flow through Redis, gateway, and Telegram.
- Observability is required: OTEL -> Typesense (`otel_events`) -> Convex/UI surfaces.
- CLI-first operations are expected; prefer `joelclaw`, `slog`, and skill commands instead of direct daemon/db/process pokes.

## Always-follow execution contract (from OpenAI Codex prompting guide)

1. No preamble, no plans, and no “I’ll do X then Y” narration.
2. Preserve strict action-first output:
   - do exactly what the user asked
   - include only necessary confirmation
   - return direct results.
3. Keep prompts structured and executable.
4. Preserve one clear objective and constrained scope.
5. Prioritize safe shell/tool actions and explicit failure handling.
6. Use parallel tool calls whenever independent work can run concurrently.
7. Use durable workflow patterns in Codex loops:
   - explicit IDs
   - explicit rollback/retry context
   - structured outputs for downstream steps.

## Canonical request format for Codex handoff

Use this exact shape unless the user already provided a better one:

- Goal: `<single concrete outcome>`
- Context: `<repo/path/runtime facts>`
- Constraints: `<time/risk/tool limits>`
- Do:
  - `<task 1>`
  - `<task 2>`
- Deliver:
  - `<artifact paths>`
  - `<verification commands + expected signals>`
- Rollback:
  - `<quick recovery command>`

If asking Codex to operate this repo, include absolute paths and the owning system paths (`apps/web`, `packages/system-bus`, etc.).

## Skill routing reminders

When Codex output needs deeper execution, remind Codex to use these local/system skills first:

- `inngest` and `inngest-durable-functions` for durable work definitions and retries
- `gateway` and `gateway-diagnose` for session/event bridge and Telegram path checks
- `o11y-logging` for telemetry-first implementations
- `joelclaw-system-check` for full environment health checks
- `skill-creator` when defining/expanding skill content
- `joelclaw` CLI (`status`, `runs`, `logs`, etc.) for validation

If context is web work, add:
- `joelclaw-web`, `frontend-design`, and any relevant `next-*` skill.

## What to include in prompts

For any Codex-requested operational run:
- exact paths
- exact command(s) to run
- expected signals for success/failure
- idempotency strategy
- rollback command.

For any code change:
- file targets (absolute or repo-relative)
- compatibility constraints
- observability check to prove behavior.

## Mac volume mounting note

- Do not assume this is solved universally.
- Treat macOS volume mount failures as environmental and include explicit mount/permission checks before retries.
- If failures recur, route through retry + diagnostic signal collection before reattempt.

## Trigger and detection notes

- This is an intent skill: treat natural language variants as valid.
- If user includes any of:
  - "send to codex"
  - "prompt codex"
  - "use codex"
  - "ask codex"
  - "delegate to codex"
  - "run in codex"
  then route here first.
- If phrasing is vague, ask one minimal clarification and keep the response minimal.

## Quick command patterns

```bash
rg -n "toolName\\\":\\\"codex\\\"|send to codex|prompt codex|use codex|ask codex|delegate to codex|delegate this to codex|run this in codex|run in codex|handoff to codex|handoff this to codex|codex this" ~/.pi/agent/sessions
joelclaw status
joelclaw runs --count 10 --hours 24
joelclaw otel stats --hours 24
```
