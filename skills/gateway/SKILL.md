# Gateway Operations

The gateway daemon is the always-on pi session that receives events from Inngest functions, Telegram, and webhooks. It's the system's notification and communication layer.

**Rule: Always use `joelclaw gateway` CLI. Never use `launchctl`, `curl`, or log file grep directly.**

## CLI Commands

```bash
joelclaw gateway status    # Sessions, queue depths, Redis health
joelclaw gateway restart   # Roll daemon, clean Redis, fresh session
joelclaw gateway test      # Push test event, verify delivery
joelclaw gateway push --type <type> [--payload JSON]  # Push to all sessions
joelclaw gateway events    # Peek at pending events per session
joelclaw gateway drain     # Clear all event queues
joelclaw gateway stream    # NDJSON stream of all gateway events (ADR-0058)
```

`joelclaw gateway restart` is the canonical restart. It kills the process, cleans Redis state, waits for launchd to respawn, and verifies the new session. Never use `launchctl bootout/bootstrap` directly.

## Quick Triage

Run in order, stop at first failure:

```bash
joelclaw gateway status    # 1. Is it alive? Sessions registered?
joelclaw gateway test      # 2. Can events flow end-to-end?
joelclaw gateway events    # 3. Are events piling up? (backpressure)
joelclaw gateway restart   # 4. If stuck, restart
```

If `joelclaw gateway status` shows pending > 0 on sessions, the agent is mid-stream or stuck. If it persists after a minute, restart.

## Sending Events from Inngest Functions

Every Inngest function receives `gateway` via middleware (ADR-0035):

```typescript
async ({ event, step, ...rest }) => {
  const gateway = (rest as any).gateway as GatewayContext | undefined;

  await step.run("notify", async () => {
    if (!gateway) return;
    await gateway.notify("my.event.type", {
      message: "Human-readable summary",
      data: "structured-payload",
    });
  });
}
```

| Method | Purpose | Routing |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `gateway.progress(msg, extra?)` | Pipeline/loop progress | Origin session + central gateway |
| `gateway.notify(type, payload?)` | Notifications (task done, webhook) | Origin session + central gateway |
| `gateway.alert(msg, extra?)` | System warnings (disk, service down) | Central gateway only |

Import: `import type { GatewayContext } from "../middleware/gateway";`

Always null-check `gateway` — functions can run without a gateway session.

## Low-Level: pushGatewayEvent()

For code outside the middleware:

```typescript
import { pushGatewayEvent } from "./agent-loop/utils";

await pushGatewayEvent({
  type: "video.downloaded",
  source: "inngest/video-download",
  payload: { message: "Downloaded: My Talk" },
  originSession: event.data.originSession,
});
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Status shows healthy but messages don't arrive | Session stuck mid-stream on hung tool call | `joelclaw gateway restart` |
| Pending events growing on a session | Agent processing or blocked | Wait 1min, then `joelclaw gateway restart` |
| Telegram messages not delivered | HTML parsing error in response | Check `joelclaw gateway status`, restart |
| Gateway restarts every few seconds | Crash loop — bad secret lease or code error | Check `/tmp/joelclaw/gateway.err`, fix cause |
| Redis connection failed | Redis pod down | `joelclaw status` to check k8s health |

## Architecture

```
launchd (com.joel.gateway)
  └─ gateway-start.sh (leases secrets, sets env)
       └─ bun run daemon.ts
            ├─ createAgentSession() → headless pi session (reads SOUL.md)
            ├─ Redis channel (joelclaw:notify:gateway)
            ├─ Telegram channel (@JoelClawPandaBot)
            ├─ WebSocket (port 3018, for TUI attach)
            ├─ Command queue (serial — one prompt at a time)
            └─ Heartbeat runner (periodic autonomous checks)
```

The gateway reads `~/.pi/agent/` at boot, which includes SOUL.md (§ Agency: "act, don't narrate"), AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, and today's daily log. This is the layer that has the system philosophy — downstream agents (codex, claude) get clean technical prompts.
