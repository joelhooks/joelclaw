## Opening Hooks

Joel never opens with "In this article..." — he drops you into a moment, a question, or a statement that creates immediate tension.

> 290 pounds and I couldn't walk and talk at the same time.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> Have you used Jira? It's a hellscape of dates, swim lanes, buzzers, metrics, and productivity wanking that leads to an entire career option of full-time employment as a Jira wrangler.
— "Instead of due dates"

> Recording a podcast is a shitload of work. I'm not gonna try to polish that aspect of it and make it seem like it is anything but work.
— "The egghead Podcast"

> Most personal AI projects start with a database. PostgreSQL, SQLite, maybe a vector store. You model your data, build an API, wire up auth. We started there too. Then we asked a different question.
— "AT Protocol as Bedrock"

> There's a moment in every infrastructure project where you stop and ask: _do I still need the thing I thought I was building toward?_
— "Why I Built My Own AI System"

> For years I spent immense amounts of effort broadcasting one-off emails to my newsletter.
— "Shadow Newsletter"

> Most boom arms are cheap pieces of shit that struggle to hold your mic still, make noise, don't hold their position, and are generally bad.

> I've spent the last 10 years working from the comfort and convenience of my home office. 6 of those years have been fcused on building a 100% completely distributed team.
— "Work from Home"

---

## Strategic Profanity

Not gratuitous. Each instance earns its place by adding emphasis, honesty, or texture.

> I'm convinced that paginated posted sorted chronologically fuckin' sucks.
— "Digital Garden"

> No "growth hacks" or other bullshit involved, just helping people in a real way.
— "Badass: Making Users Awesome"

> It's just fuckin' guessing anyway, and pulling numbers out of my ass to paste them into a spreadsheet is **definitely not the flavor of collaboration that I am looking for**.
— "Instead of due dates"

> The paid products are **really fucking good**. They are the real deal.
— "What I know about freelancing"

> Being able to work remotely is probably one of the coolest fuckin things that's ever happened to me.
— "Remote Work: Over-communicate"

> **Fuck you cigarettes.**
— "2014 in Review"

> My success metric is **maximizing free time**. The ability to do **whatever the fuck I want**.
— "Setting Goals for My Version of Success"

> We provide instructors with a **world class highly skilled production team that they don't have to fuckin manage**. We do the work. We get shit done.
— "Making Other People Money"

---

## Short Punchy Paragraphs

Joel's signature rhythm: short, shorter, then a longer sentence, then a punch.

> A garden is usually a place where things grow.
>
> Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a source of food and substance.
— "Digital Garden"

> We do the work. We get shit done.
— "Making Other People Money"

— "Badass: Making Users Awesome"

> I'm a shit PM.
>
> This is something that I will freely admit.

> That hit different.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> That wasn't it at all.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> This. More of this.
— "2014 in Review"

---

## Bold Emphasis Patterns

Bold marks the key insight within a sentence — the phrase you'd stress if speaking aloud.

> Don't just upgrade your **product**, upgrade your **users**.
— "Badass"

> **If it's negotiable, you'll negotiate your way out.** I always had.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

— "Badass"

---

## Self-Deprecating Honesty

Joel doesn't pretend to have it all figured out. Vulnerability is texture, not performance.

> I'm a shit PM. This is something that I will freely admit.
— "Instead of due dates"

> I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time ;)
— "2014 in Review"

> Humbling to log a Sour Patch Kid, but I could do it.

— "Digital Garden"

> For most of the year I've been slowly writing a book... For the most part, it serves as a source of guilt.
— "2014 in Review"

> Writing is something I enjoy, so I will get back at it. I'm in a weird middle space where I feel like I've got interesting things to say about bootstrapping a business over technical topics. The problem is I lack confidence, which isn't rational, because by any measure I've got some experience in the area now.
— "2014 in Review"

> I rolled my eyes. "That's fuckin crazy." ... Exercise in FRONT of people?!
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

---

— "How to Choose a Framework"

> Have you ever used a service that you really enjoyed which then got acquired by a larger business only to be either ruined or shut down completely? It sucks.

— "Self-Hosting"

> Am I a failure because my "churn rate" is high?
— "Setting Goals"

> *"What would happen if I did this for a year?"*
— "Getting Jacked at 50" (recurring refrain)

---

## Analogies and Metaphors

Joel uses vivid, concrete comparisons — often unexpected.

> Your evergreen newsletter sequence is a bonsai tree.
— Title, "Bonsai Tree"

> React is a Potato Plant.
— Title, "React is a Potato Plant"

> In some ways [Kubernetes] reminds me of Vim, where you'll install it and use somebody's dotfiles or follow a tutorial and add ALL of the plugins, only to be left with a confusing soup of keybindings and features that you don't understand. 🤡

## Crediting People

Joel always names his sources and collaborators. This is non-negotiable.

— "Getting Jacked at 50"

---

## Abrupt Endings

Joel doesn't do "In conclusion..." — posts end naturally, often with warmth.

> Life is good.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> Bring it New Year.
— "2014 in Review"

— "Freelancing"

## Philosophical Voice

When Joel articulates principles, he's direct and declarative — no hedging.

— "Strategy of Preeminence"

— "Badass"

> Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed. Bullshit.
— "On Writing More"

> I ran a business for years before I realized I needed to run my body the same way.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> In tech (and beyond), often all it takes is **one asshole** to wreck something you've used and loved.
— "15 Years of Twitter"

---

## Technical Voice

When writing about systems and architecture, Joel stays conversational but becomes more precise. Tables, comparisons, and honest tradeoff assessments appear.

> AT Protocol wasn't originally designed for agent systems. It was built for social networking — Bluesky runs on it. But the primitives are exactly what a personal AI system needs.
— "AT Protocol as Bedrock"

> The gap wasn't "we need to catch up to OpenClaw." It was "deploying OpenClaw would mean running two of everything."
— "Why I Built My Own AI System"

> We've crafted a full hateos REST api with a delightful GraphQL layer over the top.
— "AWS Cloudfront" (technical post, still has personality)

> 10G ethernet is fast af and means I can edit photos and video directly from the NAS and that's cool af so now I've got 10G ethernet.
— "Self-Hosting"

> Credit where it's due. OpenClaw shaped the vision. The implementation is ours. That's not a criticism. It's an architectural decision.
— "Why I Built My Own AI System"

---

## Personal Narrative Voice

The most powerful Joel writing uses personal stories as vehicles for bigger ideas.

> I'd pace during work meetings and get out of breath. Convinced myself something was seriously wrong — got tests, scans, the whole workup. Asthma? Lung cancer? Some horrible disease? Nope. Just completely out of shape. That's it. That hit different.
— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> This still frightens me. In February I quit a job that paid very well and provided a steady stream of work. This goes against the very core of my being, but it had to happen. It was killing my focus on what I truly wanted to do.
— "2014 in Review"

> "I'm leaving my dream job to work at my dream dream job," is what he told me.

— "Getting Jacked at 50"

> For me, those goals have shifted away from specific dollar amounts, and into experiences and relationships I'd like to build. Into looking at money as a vehicle for facilitating free time. Time to relax and enjoy the brief glimmer of existence that I've been granted on Earth, and help others do the same.
— "Setting Goals"
