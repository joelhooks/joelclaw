    "Remote inspect could not be fetched in this sandbox (DNS ENOTFOUND for vercel.com).",
    "Local web build command succeeded: npx turbo run build --filter=web.",

    "lockfileCheck": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --offline --ignore-scripts",
    "lockfileOutcome": "Lockfile is up to date (offline install later fails due missing tarball in cache, not lock mismatch)",

  },
  "conclusion": "Most likely original deploy failure cause was pnpm frozen-lockfile mismatch and it has already been repaired by commit 1339e1c. No new code change was needed in this run."
