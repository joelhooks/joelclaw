## The 10 Steps

| # | Outcome | Working system after |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Message an LLM from your phone | Messaging client → CLI → LLM → reply |
| 2 | Agent remembers you across sessions | Persistent memory layer |
| 3 | Agent performs actions beyond chat | Skills, tools, CLI access |
| 4 | Runs on your hardware 24/7 | Self-hosted on Mac Mini / NUC / whatever |
| 5 | Jobs survive crashes and restarts | Durable event-driven workflows |
| 6 | Agent searches your personal knowledge | Ingestion pipelines + hybrid search |
| 7 | Agent has your personality and values | Soul.md, identity, constitutional constraints |
| 8 | You trust it with real access | Sandboxing, permissions, threat model |
| 9 | Agent creates tangible output | Publishing, automations, artifacts |
| 10 | System improves over time | Feedback loops, community, new skills |

Each step: clear learner outcome → scenario challenge → try-it-now → decision forks with optionality.
