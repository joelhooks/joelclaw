# AI Coworkers Need a Form Factor, Not Better Prompts

In the talk [Form factors for your new AI coworkers — Craig Wattrus, Flatfile](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI), the core insight is not bigger model stacks; it is building the **interaction contract** first. [Craig Wattrus](https://www.youtube.com/@aiDotEngineer) frames AI as a role assignment problem, not a text-generation problem, with four modes in play: [invisible](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=116), [ambient](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=120), [inline](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=126), and [conversational](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=130). A model in a box only works when the box is well designed.

[Flatfile](https://flatfile.com/) uses that model inside a concrete product stack. User signup, schema inference, [validation](https://flatfile.com/product/transform/), and app generation happen as background actions, while humans stay on the approval rail. The sharp move is not **more autonomy**; it is better **human authority** through status signals, [snapshots](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=732), and easy rollback, so AI can be aggressive without becoming irreversible.

For [joelclaw](https://joelclaw.com), this is directly useful because the value is in how an [agent loop](https://joelclaw.com/system/events) behaves, not how long its prompt is. If every coworker mode is explicit — silent processing, ambient assistance, in-work editing, and conversational checkpoints for handoff — then the system starts feeling like a team instead of a noisy bot farm.

## Key Ideas

- **Form-factor design**: Treating [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) as [invisible](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=116), [ambient](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=120), [inline](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=126), and [conversational](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=130) shifts architecture from a single chat lane into mode-based experience design.
- **Coworker not chatbot**: The talk repeatedly maps [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) from always-in-your-face [conversational mode](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=130) to a teammate that works in the background and enters conversation only when useful.
- **Good interface is the control system**: In the [build-mode demo](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=206), transformation and configuration actions are generated quickly, but the user decides what lands.
- **Approval as product surface**: [Snapshot/rollback behavior](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=732) makes trust measurable; you can inspect and undo before trust collapses.
- **Coaching mindset**: A shift from “control every output” to “set constraints and check alignment” appears in the [character coach framing](https://youtu.be/CiMVKnX-CNI?t=656).
