# Named Scheduling Links as Project-Scoped Entry Points

[SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com) lets you create **named scheduling links** scoped to specific projects or contexts — not just a single generic "book a call" page. The [MEGA course project link](https://savvycal.com/joel-hooks/mega) is a dedicated entry point for instructor calls on that project, shared via Slack DM to keep the routing tight.

The pattern here is **one link per context**. Instead of a single `/joel-hooks` page that handles every type of meeting, each project gets its own slug. The person clicking it doesn't have to pick a meeting type or explain why they're booking — the link already carries that context. Less friction, better signal when reviewing what's on the calendar.

[SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com) differentiates from [Calendly](https://calendly.com) by letting the recipient overlay their own calendar during booking, which cuts the back-and-forth. The named-link pattern works on either tool, but the overlay is what makes SavvyCal's version particularly smooth for external collaborators who aren't already in your org.

## Key Ideas

- **Project-scoped scheduling links** carry context so the booker doesn't have to explain themselves
- [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com) calendar overlay reduces scheduling friction for external collaborators
- Named slugs (`/mega`, `/coaching`, `/discovery`) act as lightweight routing for different meeting types
- Sharing links via DM keeps the entry point **invitation-only** — no public discovery, no spam bookings

## Links

- [SavvyCal — Joel's MEGA link](https://savvycal.com/joel-hooks/mega)
