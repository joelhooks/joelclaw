# AI Hero as a New Frame for Developer Education

This is a Google Doc flagged as "ai hero incoming." The document itself couldn't be extracted — likely permission-gated — but the signal is clear enough to bookmark.

[TODO: Joel — what's the actual substance here? Fill in once the doc is accessible or the thing ships.]

**AI Hero** as a name suggests a positioning play: the developer who ships AI isn't just using tools, they're the protagonist. That's a [Kathy Sierra](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019) move — **don't make a better AI tutorial, make a better AI developer**. The framing matters more than the curriculum.

Worth tracking whether this ends up as a course, a platform, a community, or something weirder. The name alone carries weight in a market drowning in "AI for developers" content that's mostly wrapper-tutorial slop.

## Key Ideas

- **"AI Hero" as identity framing** — positioning the learner as protagonist rather than tool-user, echoing [Badass: Making Users Awesome](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019) principles
- **Gated Google Doc suggests pre-launch planning** — this is still in the kitchen, not on the menu yet
- **Developer education in the AI space is wide open** — most existing content is shallow quickstarts and API wrapper tutorials; a substantive play here has room to run
