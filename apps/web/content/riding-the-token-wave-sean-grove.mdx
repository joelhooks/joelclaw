Sean Grove — former OpenAI alignment researcher, OneGraph founder (acquired by Netlify), now building Linzumi — gave this talk at Sanity's inaugural dev conference at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn. It's a sequel to his ["The New Code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rABwKRsec4) keynote from AI Engineer World's Fair 2025, where he argued that specifications are becoming the fundamental unit of programming. Here he extends that from *what* to *how*.

## The Three Jobs

Grove frames the human's role through a conductor metaphor. When you have a million agents working for you, three things remain yours:

1. **Know the purpose.** Domain expertise matters more, not less. You know how the work gets applied in the real world, what problems it solves, where the edge cases live.
2. **Arrange the ensemble.** Orchestrate agents so they make forward progress. Which specialists, in what order, with what constraints. The conductor doesn't play every instrument — they know how to compose them.
3. **Review the result.** Judge whether the output is faithful to your vision and intent. Taste and judgment become the bottleneck. Not execution capacity.

Everything else in the talk — the steam engine metaphor, the four requirements, the spec-driven demo — is infrastructure for making these three jobs possible at scale.

## The Steam Engine Metaphor

The central metaphor lands hard. Steam power was useless until humanity reshaped the earth with railroad tracks and reshaped their problems into train-sized containers. Token power demands the same:

1. **Build connective infrastructure** — tools, APIs, monitoring that let LLMs perceive and modify your domain
2. **Reshape your problems** — make it so adding more compute yields monotonically better results

The AI labs are building the general infrastructure. Your leverage is in un-hobbling LLMs *in your specific domain*.

## Four Requirements

Grove's framework for riding the wave:

- **Express** — State what you want with precision. Way harder than it sounds.
- **Shape** — Structure the problem so more tokens = better results.
- **Prove** — Verify in the small that agents are faithfully executing your vision.
- **Scale** — Once proof works, pour in compute with confidence.

## The Demo

He shows a spec-driven development tool where a conversational interview extracts intent, generates mood boards and screen mock-ups, identifies ambiguities and contradictions in the specification, and creates a closed loop where agents self-correct against the spec.

The key insight: once you have visual mock-ups and behavioral claims in a spec, agents can self-evaluate. Generate → screenshot → compare to spec → fix. That's a problem where more compute = more iterations = better results.

## Ambiguity as the Enemy

Before launching a thousand agents, you have to extract and resolve ambiguities. The demo shows automated claim extraction — finding where you said "kid-friendly" but never defined age range, or where anonymous publishing contradicts content safety.

This is the part that maps directly to what I'm building. The [memory system](/teaching-my-system-to-remember) is doing the same thing at a different level — extracting structured observations from unstructured sessions so the system can detect its own contradictions and recurring failures.

## Trust and Legibility

> "What would it take for you to trust a 14-million-line PR that touches something incredibly sensitive and business critical?"

His answer: it's not about the size of the change. It's about the **legibility** of the change. If you don't understand a small change, don't accept it. If you understand the properties of a large change, it should be fine.

Rubber-stamping isn't human-in-the-loop — it's a liability sink. You need evidence that properties hold, not just sign-off.

## Everyone Becomes a Leader

> "If you have a hundred thousand agents or a million agents working for you, you are by definition one of the most powerful leaders in the history of humanity."

Domain expertise, taste, and judgment become the bottleneck — not execution capacity. The conductor metaphor works: you're a master of dozens of skills who knows how to put them together.

## Amateur vs. Professional

The Q&A pushes on what happens to people who love writing code. Grove's answer:

> "One of my favorite terms is amateur. We use it as a pejorative right now. But the meaning is really beautiful. It's someone who does something for the love of it."

If you love programming, do it for the love. But competing professionally as a hand-coder may become like artisanal hat-making — the market for "locally produced, handcrafted code" might exist, but it'll cost more and be a niche.
