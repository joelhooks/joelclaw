I've been frustrated for years watching voice apps like SuperWhisper and Wispr Flow do amazing local transcription but be completely useless in the car. No CarPlay means they're dead to me when I actually need hands-free.

So I built my own. It's rough as hell but it works.

## Why Voice At All

Voice is a UI for getting shit done when typing is impractical. Walking the dog. Making dinner. Driving. The dream is CarPlay integration — "Hey, implement that feature from yesterday's PRD." The agent asks clarifying questions during the commute, and there's a PR waiting when I get home.

That's the vision. The reality is way jankier.

## What I Actually Built

[ADR-0043](/adrs/0043-agent-voice-conversations) laid out the plan. Self-hosted LiveKit for the media server, but I'm not kidding myself — this thing depends on cloud services for everything that matters. Deepgram for speech-to-text. Claude for the actual thinking. ElevenLabs for voice. Telnyx for phone connectivity.

The architecture splits across two machines because Tailscale Funnel doesn't do UDP:

- **Mac Mini**: Runs LiveKit, the voice agent, all the core stuff
- **DigitalOcean droplet**: Public IP for SIP, routes calls back through Tailscale

When you call, it goes: Phone → Telnyx → SIP gateway → LiveKit room → Voice agent wakes up. The agent has all my tools — calendar, tasks, email, vault search. Same capabilities as text, just through voice.

## The Honest State of It

Let me be real: voice is still kind of dumb. I've barely used it. Talking to an AI isn't natural for me and probably won't be without a lot of practice and tuning.

What's annoying:
- **The lag**: 1-2 seconds feels like forever in conversation
- **Response sensitivity**: Doesn't feel natural, timing is off
- **Personality**: Panda's Australian accent and swearing is fun in theory but still feels forced
- **The whole vibe**: It's just awkward talking to nobody

It beats the shit out of Siri (admittedly a low bar 💀) but this is rough edge baby voice integration. Lots of very smart people at big companies are working on making voice feel natural. My self-hosted Python script cobbled together from tutorials isn't that refined.

## What Actually Works

Despite all that, some things are genuinely useful:

**Q&A for writing**: Voice conversations avoid AI writing slop. When I talk through ideas, the agent asks questions, I give real answers in my actual voice. No "In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape" bullshit. This article came from exactly that process.

**Quick tasks while moving**: "Add a task to call the dentist tomorrow" while making coffee. "What's on my calendar today?" while getting dressed. Basic, but it works.

**Emails and messages**: Voice-to-text for mundane communication. Not revolutionary but saves the context switch.

## What Needs to Happen

For this to not suck:

1. **Native app + CarPlay**: This is everything. Voice without CarPlay is pointless.
2. **Way lower latency**: Sub-second or it's unusable for real conversation
3. **Better interruption handling**: Let me cut the agent off naturally
4. **Personality that doesn't annoy me**: Still searching for the right voice/vibe

I'm also building a public mode — anyone can call and ask about joelclaw, browse ADRs, understand the architecture. Different context, restricted tools. Like office hours but 24/7 and automated.

## The Real Point

This isn't about having the best voice interface. It's about learning what actually matters for voice interactions with my own tools. Every jank conversation teaches me something about what needs to be better.

Maybe in six months this evolves into something actually good. Maybe voice stays a party trick. But I had to try building it to find out.

The code works. The experience needs everything.
