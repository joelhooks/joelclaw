[Simon Willison flagged](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/21/claws/) an Andrej Karpathy tweet that caught my attention. Karpathy bought a Mac Mini — apparently Apple stores are "selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused" — to tinker with what he's calling **Claws**.

His definition:

> Just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

That's... exactly what I've been building. joelclaw is a Claw by this definition and I didn't know the word existed until today.

## What makes a Claw a Claw

Karpathy doesn't give a formal spec, but reading between the lines plus Willison's gloss, a Claw is:

- **Runs on personal hardware** — Mac Mini, home server, your own metal
- **Communicates via messaging protocols** — Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS, voice
- **Handles both direct instructions and scheduled tasks** — you can tell it things AND it does things on its own
- **Orchestration + persistence** — not just a chat session that forgets everything

joelclaw checks every box. [Inngest for durable workflows](/inngest-is-the-nervous-system). [Gateway daemon](/building-a-gateway-for-your-ai-agent) for messaging. Qdrant + Redis + Vault for persistence. Cron heartbeats. Voice via LiveKit SIP. Todoist as async conversation channel. It's a Claw. It's been a Claw. We just didn't have the word.

## The proliferation

Karpathy notes NanoClaw (~4,000 lines core engine, runs in containers), plus nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw. The prefix game is real.

He's "sus'd" on OpenClaw specifically but loves the concept. I get it. OpenClaw is the one that proved the idea works. Whether you run their code or build your own — and I [chose to build my own](/building-my-own-openclaw) — the architectural pattern is clear enough that implementations are converging independently.

## The "fits in your head" constraint

The NanoClaw detail that stuck with me: ~4,000 lines for the core engine, which "fits into both my head and that of AI agents." That's a real design constraint worth taking seriously. joelclaw's system-bus is larger than that, but it also does more — durable workflows, [multi-phase memory](/observation-pipeline-persistent-ai-memory), multi-channel gateway, [voice agent](/voice-agent-deployment-deep-dive).

The question isn't whether 4K lines is the right number. It's whether your agent can read its own source code and understand what it does. That's the bar for self-improvement. If the system is too complex for the agent to reason about, you've built a system the agent can use but never fix.

joelclaw can read its own code. It regularly does — codex sessions modify the system-bus, the gateway extension, the CLI. Whether it truly *understands* the full system is a different question. But the architecture is legible enough that agents can work on it. That matters more than line count.

## The name

"Claw" is good. It's short, it's concrete, it implies grabbing things and doing stuff. Better than "personal AI agent system" or "OpenClaw-inspired architecture." And 🦞 is a fine emoji.

Karpathy has an ear for this — he gave us "vibe coding" and "agentic engineering." Both stuck. I think "Claw" sticks too.
