**Duplicate collisions:** 0088 (×2), 0089 (×2)

## Supersession Hygiene

- Many `superseded-by` fields are empty even when successor ADRs are named in body text
- Cross-references are one-way in several cases
- Recommend: normalize all supersession links bidirectionally

## Stale Proposals

No proposals older than 2 weeks (oldest: 2026-02-14). Several proposed ADRs appear thin or stalled: 0017, 0026, 0027. Worth a triage pass to reject or enrich.
