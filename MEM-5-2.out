Both packages are installed. Let me also check what the test does with module resolution - it imports from the absolute path and mocks `ioredis`. Since bun resolves modules from the importing file's location, bun will look for `ioredis` in pi-tools' node_modules when importing from `/Users/joel/Code/joelhooks/pi-tools/session-lifecycle/index.ts`. This should work.

Let me do a quick summary check of all changes made:

1. **`/Users/joel/Code/joelhooks/pi-tools/package.json`**: Added `ioredis` and `@sinclair/typebox` as direct dependencies; pinned peer deps to `~0.52.12`
2. **`/Users/joel/Code/joelhooks/pi-tools/tsconfig.json`**: Created with `session-lifecycle/**/*.ts` scope
3. **`/Users/joel/Code/joelhooks/pi-tools/session-lifecycle/index.ts`**:
   - Added `import Redis from "ioredis"`
   - Added Redis `LLEN memory:review:pending` query in the briefing section
   - When count > 0: appends the pending proposals line to the briefing
   - When count = 0: no proposal line
   - Redis errors caught and swallowed
   - Fixed pre-existing type errors: `details: null` in `execute`, `"content" in message` guard for message mapping
   - Fixed `execute` signature to include `_signal, _onUpdate, _ctx` params

The implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria:
- AC-1: Queries `LLEN memory:review:pending` from Redis at `localhost:6379`
- AC-2: When count > 0, briefing includes `📋 {N} pending memory proposals — run \`joelclaw review\` or say "review proposals" to see them`
- AC-3: When count is 0, no proposal line appears
- AC-4: Redis errors are caught, briefing continues
- AC-5: `bunx tsc --noEmit` exits 0
