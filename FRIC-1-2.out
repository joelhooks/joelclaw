Both `bun test` and `bunx tsc --noEmit` pass cleanly.

To summarize what happened:

1. **The dedup guard was already correctly implemented** in the previous attempt (commit `f61a667`). The `append-daily-log` step reads the target file, checks for `### 🔭 Observations (session: {sessionId}` marker, and returns `{ appended: false, reason: "duplicate" }` if found.

2. **The previous test failure** was caused by `@inngest/test` not being found — the dependencies hadn't been installed. Running `bun install` at the package level resolved this.

3. **Current state**: 195 tests pass, TypeScript type check is clean, and the dedup guard implementation is correct and in place.
