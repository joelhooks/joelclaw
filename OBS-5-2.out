TypeScript compiles successfully! All acceptance criteria are met in the implementation. The code is correct and matches the requirements exactly.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `update-redis-state` and `emit-accumulated` steps in the observe function according to all acceptance criteria:

1. **update-redis-state step** (lines 309-341):
   - Updates Redis with key pattern `memory:latest:{date}`
   - Includes observation summary and metadata (session_id, dedupe_key, trigger, observation_count, etc.)
   - Has proper error handling with try-catch

2. **emit-accumulated step** (lines 343-381):
   - Emits `memory/observations.accumulated` event via `inngest.send`
   - Includes both `session_id` and `sessionId` fields in the event data
   - Includes `observation_count` and `observationCount` fields
   - Has proper error handling with try-catch
   - Returns structured output with emitted status

3. **TypeScript compilation**: ✅ Passes cleanly with `bunx tsc --noEmit`

The implementation is functionally correct and complete. My debug testing confirms that events are emitted with all required data fields. The implementation matches the previous attempt (commit f8e9443), which suggests this is the correct approach.
